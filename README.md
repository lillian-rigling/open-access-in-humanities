# open-access-in-humanities

Hello future collaborators! 

Weâ€™re creating resources for and working with humanities researchers and educators to find ways to integrate open practices into their workflows and articulate the value of humanities work so that educators and learners can have better access to the breadth of extant and emerging humanities research.

This project's output is going to be a research hub and resource guide to help learners discover, use, and be a part of humanities discourse in the academy. Using our collective skills as librarians, researchers, and storytellers, we are hoping to create a collaborative hub and community to learn more and do more with humanities research.

Where can you come in?

We are currently looking for assistance in the following spaces:
* Are you a humanities researcher looking to open up your research?
* Are you an educator looking for resources?
* Do you know about great resources for open access in the humanities?
* Do you have a story about the need for open access in the humanities?

Get in touch! You can leave a comment on the repo or tweet at @little_wow or @lilyrglg

Thanks!

Jennie + Lilian
